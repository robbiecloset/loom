# Loom <3 Max for Live

I love [loom][1]. It's probably my favorite sequencer. I wanted to expand on it, and since I work primarily in Live, and increasingly "in the box," I thought Max for Live would be a good fit for the environment.

This is very much a WIP.

MVP checklist:
[ ] Saves (I don't know yet how this works along side M4L)
[ ] Add all other scales

Further roadmap:
[ ] Update note & trigger ticking to scale based on length of note or trigger
[ ] Pad the grid?
[ ] Monome grid support
